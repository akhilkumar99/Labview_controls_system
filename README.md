# Labview_controls_system
***A combination of all the plots used in control system for stability analysis of a given system***

\* This Labview file includes all the plots and results of a given tranfer function. This will be helpful when solving problems related to control systems, just for cross verification.
\* a detailed analysis of the tranfer function, state space analysis, delays, phase and gain margin, pole-zero analysis etc. is provided.
\* To run this file one must have a LabVIEW software installed in the PC or Laptop, also one must have LabVIEW 201X Control Design and Simulation Module, you can find the module in the repo. just download and activate this module using LabVIEW Activator.
