# Labview_controls_system
##  
***A combination of all the plots used in control system for stability analysis of a given system***

* This Labview file includes all the plots and results of a given tranfer function. This will be helpful when solving problems related to control systems, just for cross verification.
* a detailed analysis of the tranfer function, state space analysis, delays, phase and gain margin, pole-zero analysis etc. is provided.
* To run this file one must have a LabVIEW software installed in the PC or Laptop, also one must have LabVIEW 201X Control Design and Simulation Module, download and activate the Control Design module using LabVIEW Activator.
